This source code is written in MATLAB R2018b. There are multiple functions packaged for each part, with a main function that runs each section in turn.




**Objects**

The directory should be changed to the *'Objects'* folder and the file *'ICV_part5_main'* should be run. 

This will load the *'DatasetC.mpg'* video and apply frame differencing to two different frames, presenting both the frame differenced and thresholded images. This is done with both reference frame as the first frame and the previous frame.

A background image is then generated from the video. Finally, the moving objects within each frame are calculated and a running bar plot is portrayed. The Command Window will prompt a key press to move through each section.
