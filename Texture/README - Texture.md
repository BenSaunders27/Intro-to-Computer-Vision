This source code is written in MATLAB R2018b. There are multiple functions packaged for each part, with a main function that runs each section in turn.



**Texture**

The directory should be changed to the *'Texture'* folder and the file *'ICV_part6_main'* should be run. 

This will read the required images and first perform local LBP description on certain windows of the image, with the histograms shown. Then a global LBP descriptor is shown as a global histogram. 

This global histogram is used for classification, with 4 images being classified each run. This classification is done with decreased and increased window sizes. The Command Window will prompt a key press to move through each section.
