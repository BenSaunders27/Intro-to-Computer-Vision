**<u>Introduction to Computer Vision</u>**

This source code is written in MATLAB R2018b. There are multiple functions packaged for each part, with a main function that runs each section in turn.



**Transformation**

The directory should be changed to the *'Transformation'* folder and the file *'ICV_part1_main'* should be run. 

This will load the *'Name image.png'* image and perform each Rotation and Skew in turn. The resulting transformed images will be printed out, with the Command Window prompting a key press to move to the next image transformation.
