This source code is written in MATLAB R2018b. There are multiple functions packaged for each part, with a main function that runs each section in turn.



**Motion Estimation**

The directory should be changed to the *'Motion Estimation'* folder and the file *'ICV_part4_main'* should be run. 

This will load the relevant frames (It & It+1) from the *'DatasetC.mpg'* video and display both the motion field and the predicted image, Pt+1. The relevant Block sizes and Window sizes will be run with the predicted image printed out. The Command Window will prompt a key press to move to the next prediction.
